# LandingPage
  Simple website page , using HTML and CSS created within the "Coding Challenge" organized by the GoIT company.
    In this coding marathon, I embraced the challenge of translating a Figma file into a fully functional website using HTML and CSS.This hands-on journey wasn't just about writing code -  it was about understanding the nuances of design, mastering the principles of web development, and pushing the boundaries of my skillset. From pixel-perfect layouts to seamless interactions, this project epitomized my dedication to craftmanship and continual learning.
